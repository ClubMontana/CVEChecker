# CVE Checker

Allows you to check for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) by either entering a specific CVE ID, a device name, or an IP address. It uses the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) API to retrieve information about vulnerabilities.

## Prerequisites
```
- Python 3
- Install requests
```

###### Installation

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt in the directory where the script is located.
3. Run the following command to install the required libraries:
```
pip3 install requests
```

## Usage
```
python3 cve_checker.py
```

**_You will be prompted to enter your choice of action, either to search for a CVE by ID, device name, or IP address. Enter your choice and follow the prompts to retrieve information about the relevant vulnerabilities._**
